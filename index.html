            <p>Developed as part of two recent artist residencies during 2019 and 2020, 
            'Exit Between the Days' is a short duration Mask theatre piece using a minimalistic soundtrack, movement cycles 
            This piece deals with the sensations of wanting connection and the rituals of the quotidian, touching on the themes of aloneness, migration, elderly in society and the average person waking in their room at night, thoughts dancing in their head.
            The piece uses the idea of a light acting as the antagonist and that the use of objects and ritual in its forms and intensities will become its own motivator.
            Using objects such as a suitcases, clothes, chair,  lightshade and a coat rack, I want to show that  habit or ritual  in action, in its various forms and intensities will form the story in the piece.</p>

        <p>With a designer i have over a series of sculpts from me and her created an archetypal mask to create an old man character who will act as the protaganist.
        So i would like to further explore this characters interaction with this world of soundscapes, lightscapes and need for ritual.
        I have drawn inspiration from previous experience with full masks during my studies at  Ecole Internationale de Théâtre Lassaad, my training in corporeal mime over many years and seeing mask  performances such as those by Berlin based theatre company 'Family Floz'.
        As mentioned, this idea came to me from the abstract notion of what effect soundscapes, object and movement can envoke in the viewer.
